# Life Expectancy SQL Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive SQL analysis of life expectancy trends across countries, genders, and time periods. It leverages advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, conditional aggregation, and benchmarking to uncover meaningful insights.

## Key Analyses
The project includes 10 insightful queries:
- Overall highest and lowest life expectancy records
- Year-wise highest and lowest by country and gender
- Top 10 countries (highest and lowest average life expectancy)
- Gender comparisons globally and by country
- Country-wise trends over time
- Gender gap analysis (Female – Male expectancy)
- Year-on-year changes using `LAG()`
- Global vs country benchmarking
- Top country’s best and worst years with gender breakdown

## Features Used
Advanced SQL techniques demonstrated:
- Window functions (`RANK()`, `LAG()`)
- Subqueries and derived tables
- Conditional aggregation (`CASE WHEN`)
- Partitioning and ordering
- Grouped aggregations
